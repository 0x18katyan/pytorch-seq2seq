    "# 1 - Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series we'll be building a machine learning model to go from once sequence to another, using PyTorch and TorchText. This will be done on German to English translations, but the models can be applied to any problem that involves going from one sequence to another, such as summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start very simple to understand the general concepts by implementing the model from the [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are *encoder-decoder* models, which (commonly) use a *recurrent neural network* (RNN) to *encode* the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook we'll refer to this single vector as a *context vector*. You can think of the context vector as being some abstract representation of the input sentence in the source language. This vector is then *decoded* by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating one word at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/seq2seq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input/source sentence \"guten morgen\" is input into the encoder (green) one word at a time. We also append a \"start of sequence\" (`<sos>`) and \"end of sequence\" (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the current word, $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. You can think of the RNN as a function of both of these inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an *LSTM* or a *GRU*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have our context vector, we can start decoding it to get the output/target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the current word, $y_t$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$. Thus, the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each time-step we also use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$. We always use `<sos>` for $y_1$, but for $y_{>1}$ we will sometimes use the actual next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the last predicted word, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called *teacher forcing*, and you can read about it more [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When training/testing our model, we know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference (i.e. real world usage) it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our predicted target sentence, $\\hat{Y} = \\{ \\hat{y}_1, \\hat{y}_2, ..., \\hat{y}_T \\}$, we compare it against our actual target sentence, $Y = \\{ y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\}$, to calculate our loss. We then use this loss to update all of the parameters in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be coding up the models in PyTorch and using TorchText to help us do all of the pre-processing required. We'll also be using spaCy to assist in the tokenization of the data."

    "We'll be building our model in three parts. The encoder, the decoder and a \"seq2seq\" model that encapsulates the encoder and decoder. We do this so the whole model will simply take a source sentence as an input and output a predicted target sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the encoder, a 2 layer LSTM. In the paper they use a 4-layer LSTM, but in the interest of training time, we'll cut this down to 2-layers. The concept of multi-layer RNNs is easy to expand from 2 to 4 layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a multi-layer RNN, the input sentence goes into the first (bottom) layer of the RNN and hidden states output by this layer are used as inputs to the next layer of RNNs. This means we'll also need an initial hidden state, $h_0$, per layer and we will also output a context vector, $z$, per layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going into too much detail about LSTMs (see [this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) blog post if you want to learn more about them), all we need to know is that they're a type of RNN which instead of just taking in a hidden state and returning a new hidden state, also take in and return a *cell state*, $c$. You can just think of $c$ as another type of hidden state. This means our context vector will both the final hidden state and the final cell state, i.e. $z = (h_T, c_T)$.\n",

    "![](assets/seq2seq2.png)\n",

    "We create this in code by making an `Encoder` module, which requires we inherit from `torch.nn.Module` and use the `super().__init__()` as some boilerplate code. The encoder is takes the following arguments:\n",
    "- `input_dim` is the size/dimensionality of the one-hot vectors that will be input to the encoder. This is equal to the input (source) vocabulary size.\n",
    "- `emb_dim` is the dimensionality of the embedding layer. This layer converts the one-hot vectors into dense vectors with `emb_dim` dimensions. \n",
    "- `hid_dim` is the dimensionality of the hidden and cell states.\n",
    "- `n_layers` is the number of layers in your RNN.\n",
    "- `dropout` is the amount of dropout to use. This is a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting. Check out [this](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/understanding-dropout-YaGbR) for more details about dropout.\n",

    "The embedding layer is created using `nn.Embedding`, the LSTM with `nn.LSTM` and a dropout layer with `nn.Dropout`. Check the PyTorch [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) for more about these.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that the `dropout` argument to the LSTM is how much dropout to apply between the layers of a multi-layer RNN, i.e. between the hidden states output from layer $L$ and those same hidden states being used for the input of layer $L+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `forward` method, we pass in the source sentence which is converted into dense vectors and then dropout is applied. These embeddings are then passed into the RNN which returns: `outputs` (the top-layer hidden state for each time-step/token), `hidden` (the final hidden state for each layer, $h_T$, stacked on top of each other) and `cell` (the final cell state for each layer, $c_T$, stacked on top of each other).
